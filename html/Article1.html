          pH in Natural Mineral Water - Understanding Basics to Identify the
          Best Drinking Water
        </h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Water is essential to life; up to 60 per cent of the human body
          contains water. It is ubiquitous - found even on planets, asteroids,
          and comets. However, universal safe drinking water access, especially
          in India, is almost negligible. As per a National sample survey, only
          47% of urban households in India have individual water connections,
          and more than 50% of our districts have contaminated groundwater.
          Given these circumstances, it is paramount to consider multiple
          factors that make water safe to drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to drinking water, the source of water and the chemical
          composition that depends on the pH level must be considered. For
          example, the chemical composition of water can vary depending on where
          the water comes from. The most common sources include natural springs,
          wells, lakes and rivers. So, lets understand what is pH level in the
          water and how it benefits our health.

            Water?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          pH is an abbreviation for the Potential of Hydrogen. It measures how
          acidic or alkaline a substance is. To calculate the pH level in the
          water, scientists use a scale from 0 to 14. For example, water has a
          pH level of 7.4. The ideal pH level for mineral water is 6.5 to 8.5.
          When the natural mineral water pH level is above 6.5, water is more
          alkaline. When it is below 6, it is more acidic.
        </p>
        <p>But what does this mean for your body?</p>
        <p>
          Natural Mineral water with a pH level between 6.5 and 8.5 helps
          balance the body's pH level. It prevents diseases caused by an
          unbalanced pH level, such as heartburn, indigestion, and acid reflux.
          Natural Mineral Water can help to balance the body's pH level by
          increasing or decreasing the present hydroxide ions. Water with a high
          pH level can help fight off the bacteria in your body and neutralize
          acids. On the other hand, drinking water with a deficient pH level can
          cause stomach discomfort and diarrhoea as it doesn't have enough
          minerals to digest the food.
        </p>
        <p><strong> Why is pH Important in Natural Mineral Water?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Natural Mineral Water could be a good choice if you're looking for a
          healthier alternative for your drinking water. Its natural composition
          and high pH levels make it a healthier option than tap water. For
          example, Fettle's Vedica Water has a pH level of up to 7.9, making it
          a naturally alkaline soothing antacid.
        </p>
        <p><strong> How to Measure the pH of Natural Mineral Water?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Measuring the level of pH in natural mineral water is idiot-proof.
          Firstly, you must ensure that the container of water used for the test
          is transparent. Next, carefully remove the plastic covering from the
          pH strip and hold it vertically in the container of natural water for
          30 seconds. After 30 seconds, the strip's colour will indicate the pH
          level in the water.
        </p>
        <p><strong> The Bottom Line</strong></p>
        <p>
          pH is a measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. pH
          level helps determine water quality and is paramount when choosing
          what water to drink. Make sure you choose a trusted brand for your
          drinking water needs, as it assures the optimal pH level needed for
          you to live a healthy life. Luckily for you, one of India's most
          trusted brands of packaged drinking water - Fettle International, has
          got you covered.
