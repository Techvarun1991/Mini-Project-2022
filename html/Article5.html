        <h1>Benefits of Drinking More Water in Monsoon Season</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          After the blistering heat of summers, the rains offer great respite
          and bring with them much-needed pleasant weather. But while that is
          the bright side of monsoon season, the gloomy side is that the change
          in weather impacts your health and immune system. You also tend to
          sweat and become dehydrated, which is further going to have a negative
          impact on your health. That is why it is imperative you keep drinking
          water and stay hydrated throughout the season.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Benefits of Drinking Water in Monsoons</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Boosts Immune System</li>
          <p>
            Monsoon season is a time when most people tend to fall ill. If you
            want to avoid falling ill and build your immune system, one of the
            ways to do so is by drinking enough mineral water. It helps to rid
            the body of toxins that can have a negative effect on the immune
            system. Even when you are outdoors.
          </p>
          <li>Promotes Healthy Glowing Skin</li>
          <p>
            Many people also tend to experience pimple and acne breakouts during
            this season due to the fluctuating weather conditions. Drinking 2-3
            liters of water everyday has proven to help promote glowing skin
            since it keeps your kidneys, gut and liver healthy, boosts the
            collagen production of your skin, and keeps it hydrated and
            moisturized.
          </p>
          <li>Keeps Diseases at Bay</li>
          <p>
            This season is also the breeding time for mosquitoes and this can
            give rise to water-borne diseases such as Cholera, Typhoid,
            Diarrhea, etc. Drinking mineral water boosts your body with
            potassium and magnesium which are essential for good health. When
            you are out and about, you can keep yourself hydrated with a bottle
            of Fettle water.

            hydrated, it does the same for your hair too. You can keep the shine
            and strength intact all through the rainy season by making sure you
            keep yourself hydrated!

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>

          is also essential that you take good care of your health by drinking
