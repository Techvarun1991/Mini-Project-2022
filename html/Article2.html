        <hr />
        <p>
          Ever wondered what does a plant, an animal and you have in common?
          Each one of you heavily depends on water growth and sustenance. Did
          you know that around 60 percent of the body is made up of water, and
          around 71 percent of Earth’s surface is covered by water? It goes to
          show just how much water plays a role in our lives. But maybe it is
          the omnipresent nature of water that makes people overlook the value
          of drinking water every day and places it at the bottom of everyone’s
          list of priorities. Our bodies can go weeks without consuming food but
          will succumb within days due to the lack of enough water. That is
          because your body can transform your stored fat into energy when you
          don’t eat but there is no replacement in case of your body lacking
          water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drinking water, or staying adequately hydrated, is vital for our good
          health and survival. Considering our bodies are made up of about 60%
          water, being dehydrated can begin to affect us both physically and
          mentally. Even just a 2% reduction in water levels in the human body
          can lead to a 20% decrease in mental and physical performance. What is
          more, if you are ever feeling cranky, just grab that bottle of
          packaged drinking water and drink up - it will instantly improve your
          mood!
        </p>
        <p><strong> Importance of Drinking Water</strong></p>
        <p>
          Just like a machine cannot function properly without being well-oiled,
          a person cannot function properly without enough drinking water. Water
          is one of the essentials required for life to sustain itself. Drinking
          water can help keep your body fit and your mind healthy. It can keep
          numerous illnesses and ailments at bay by building your immune system
          and maintaining the regular functions of the various organs. What’s
          more, drinking water gets rid of toxins that can damage the gut and
          cause inflammation and irritation.
        </p>

          During a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, drinking water
          is more important. While it is not a cure to treat the virus, drinking
          water can help you detoxify the body of any unwanted germs and
          bacteria. It also plays a vital role in building and maintaining a
          strong immune system.
