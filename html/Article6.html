        <h1>Water borne diseases in monsoon: Tips to safeguard yourself</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          A thunderous monsoon at the end of a hot and humid summer is always
          welcomed with open arms. But this cold shower respite from the heat
          also brings with it a host of diseases especially, water-borne
          diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water-borne diseases are caused by a variety of microorganisms,
          bacteria, and toxic contaminants, which can lead to distressing
          illnesses like cholera, malaria, dengue, gastroenteritis, typhoid, and
          leptospirosis. When a climatic change increases the severity and
          frequency of a precipitation event like rainfall or snowfall, the
          disease burden from water-borne diseases rises swiftly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Prashant Bhatia (MBBS, DPHA, DHA, PGDMLS) clarifies, “Climate
          change and monsoon are likely to increase incidences of viral fever,
          gastroenteritis and other water-borne diseases. This is because
          stagnant monsoon water is a playground for disease-causing
          microorganisms and drinking water supply can get compromised due to
          stagnant rainwater. To maintain good health during monsoon, I always
          urge people to take adequate measures to safeguard their drinking
          water and to avoid eating at unhygienic restaurants and roadside
          vendors.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some of the precautionary measures that Dr. Prashant Bhatia
          recommends –
        </p>
        <p><strong>Focus on personal hygiene</strong></p>
        <p>
          Washing hands before eating and after using the restroom, whether at
          home or away, is the safest way to keep germs from entering your body.
          Preferably, wash your hands with running water before and after –
          eating food, toilet usage, taking medicines and wound care. Avoid
          touching your nose or eyes when riding on public transport and cover
          your mouth if you have to cough or sneeze.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Drink water from safe sources</strong></p>
        <p>
          contaminated and untreated drinking water is the biggest culprit to
          spread diseases, hence ensure you drink water from reliable sources
          only. Buy water bottles from reputed companies who follow strict
          purification procedures and conduct thorough quality tests. Reputed
          and quality conscious companies follow a multi-step water purification
          process and subject their water to over 100 quality tests to ensure
          you get purity in every drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locally packed or unbranded water from unknown companies may look
          “clean” but do not get deceived by their looks. If you are not sure
          about their safety and purification methods, then do not buy it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Boiling water is also not enough</strong></p>
        <p>
          boiling water is considered as the gold standard of water
          purification. Even though it kills bacteria and other harmful
          microorganisms, it does not remove other inorganic and dissolved
          components. Moreover, loosely covering the water vessel or matka and
          dipping a glass directly into it can invite other airborne bacteria
          defeating the whole purpose of boiling the water in the first place.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Avoid street food</strong></p>
        <p>
          No matter how tempting an onion pakora or cutting chai looks on the
          street cart, avoid street food at all costs. Not only is their source
          and purity of water questionable, but their preparation method could
          be unhygienic as well. To quench these enticing cravings, prepare such
          items at home with clean and purified water. It is always a good idea
          to eat fresh home cooked meals, avoid eating raw food, and consuming
          plenty of water. Also, have plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts as
          they boost your immunity during the rainy season.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Fix plumbing leakages at home</strong></p>
        <p>
          A leaking roof or a wet wall can be a breeding ground for
          disease-causing bacteria and fungus. Also check for leaks in the main
          water pipeline that provides drinking water to apartment septic tanks.
          Immediately repair any leakages to avoid contamination of safe
          drinking water. Look out for water stagnation at home in the
          receptacles of A/C, coolers, indoor plants, and overhead tanks.
          Designate one day a week as a ‘dry day’ where all such receptacles are
          drained off and cleaned.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Monitor the colour and odour of water</strong></p>
        <p>
          If you suspect the colour of your tap water has changed, then
          immediately inform your local authorities so that they can check where
          the contamination is happening. If any contamination is confirmed,
          then drink only packaged drinking water for few days till the tank is
          completely cleaned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heavy rainfall and the accompanying flood pose a huge threat to the
          health of the community. To ensure your health and wellbeing, eat a
          healthy diet and avoid venturing into flood affected areas. Drink safe
          and clean water from reputed companies and consult a doctor
          immediately if you feel sick.
