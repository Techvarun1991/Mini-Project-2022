        <h1>5 Reasons Why Your Skin Needs to Stay Hydrated</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          We all know that staying hydrated is imperative for our body to
          function properly and maintain good health. But staying hydrated is
          also essential if you want to have glowing, clear skin. It is drinking
          mineral water that is going to prove very beneficial for your skin in
          the long run.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Reasons To Stay Hydrated</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prevents Premature Aging</li>
          <p>
            Want to continue looking young for a long time to come? Drink water!
            The key to having younger looking skin lies in those 3-4 liters of
            water that you need to drink every day. Keeping yourself hydrated
            keeps the skin moisturized for a long time and increases the
            elasticity. This delays sagging of the skin so fine lines and
            wrinkles take a long time to take form!
          </p>
          <li>It Gets Your Skin to Glow</li>
          <p>
            When you drink enough water every day, your skin gets hydrated and
            moisturized. This helps to keep it smooth and supple. With skin so
            smooth and moisturized, it will have a radiant glow. When sunlight
            touches your skin, it will bounce off your smooth skin and give it
            that gorgeous dewy look, which would not be possible if your skin
            was rough, dull and dry. If you want that natural glow, drink some
            mineral water.
          </p>
          <li>It Prevents Acne</li>
          <p>
            In the hustle-bustle of our fast-paced lives, we are forgetting to
            give our body the attention and care it deserves. Dehydration,
            pollution and unhealthy diet are some of the reasons that are
            leaving a negative impact on our skin. While acne is a common skin
            dilemma in our teenage years, more and more adults are reporting
            cases of mild or acute acne. One of the biggest advantages of
            drinking water is that it is a great cure for reducing acne and
            clearing your skin. Drinking water helps to balance the oil and
            water content on your face’s skin. This helps to prevent excess oil
            and sebum secretion, hence fewer clogged pores and acne.
          </p>
          <li>It Reduces Wrinkles</li>
          <p>
            Drinking enough mineral water will ensure that your skin looks
            smooth and tight. Since your skin is adequately hydrated, the
            elasticity will be maintained and Water keeps your body hydrated and
            refreshed and helps maintain your skin’s elasticity. People who
            drink large amounts of water are less likely to develop wrinkles and
            scars. Hence, keeping sagging skin at bay for a long time to come!
          </p>
          <li>It Maintains pH Balance</li>
          <p>
            Whether your skin is far too oily or far too dry, one of the best
            solutions to rectify that is drinking enough water. Sensitive,
            acne-ridden skin or any other skin problem can be treated by
            correcting the pH balance of your skin by drinking enough water. Be
            consistent in your water intake and you will start noticing the
            positive difference in a few days!
          </p>
          <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
          <p>
            While you can consume water in different ways (green tea, lemon
            water, etc.), there is nothing better than just plain mineral water.
            Especially when you are out and about, you must always carry a
            bottle of water so that you can meet your daily target of water
            consumed. If you have to buy a bottle of water, nothing better than
            Fettle where the potassium and magnesium-rich water goes through a
            10-step purification process & 114 Quality Tests before being
            bottled. Now you can always stay healthy and hydrated!
