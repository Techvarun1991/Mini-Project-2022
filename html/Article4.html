        <h1>Understanding the Relation Between Hydration and Mental Health</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Good health is all about maintaining a balance between physical
          health, emotional health, mental health and social health. There are
          many things you do to ensure that you remain in good health. One of
          these is the simplest thing you can do and yet itâ€™s the one that is
          most often overlooked or neglected. You may not know but your mineral
          water intake has a huge impact on your mental health. If you are
          dehydrated, it will have a negative impact on your mood and thinking
          while staying hydrated can be an instant mood-lifter.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Ways in Which Hydration Improves Mental Health</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relaxes Your Mind</li>
          <p>
            If you ever feel relaxed or anxious or nervous, sipping on water can
            have an almost immediate effect and can calm you down. Studies have
            shown that dehydration has a negative effect on your mind since it
            is not being provided with enough oxygen. As soon as you start
            hydrating your body with mineral water, you will notice your mind
            feeling so much more at peace and at ease.
          </p>
          <li>Improves Your Mood</li>
          <p>
            You may enjoy the energy boost that caffeine gives you but if you
            want something to boost your mood, there is nothing like a glass of
            mineral water to do the trick. The effect is almost instantaneous.
            Whether you are feeling sad, angry, irritated or gloomy, just drink
            some water and watch how your mood changes for the better!
          </p>
          <li>Helps You Focus and Concentrate</li>
          <p>
            Have you ever noticed that sometimes your mind feels fuzzy and like
            you cannot correctly string your thoughts together or that you
            cannot seem to focus long enough on the topic at hand? This is your
            brain telling you that you are dehydrated. Drinking water also helps
            with improving your focus and attention span. Since you are
            providing the brain with adequate levels of oxygen, it is going to
            help you think clearly, improve your focus and maximize your
            performance.
          </p>
          <li>Boosts Brain Power</li>
          <p>
            While drinking water increases your attention span, it also makes
            you feel mentally energised and ready to blaze through the to-do
            list for the day. If you are ever feeling mentally drained, drinking
            mineral water can give it the push that it needs to ensure that it
            is working at its best.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        <p>
          To ensure good mental health, you need to remind yourself to keep
          drinking water. While it is easier to remind yourself to stay hydrated
          when at home, when you are outdoors and running errands, it can easily
          miss your notice. If you are not carrying a bottle with you, you can
          purchase a bottle of Fettle water that will ensure you nourish your
          mind and body. Stay healthy and stay hydrated!
